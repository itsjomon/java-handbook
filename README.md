# Java Programming & DSA Handbook
This repository is a structured collection of notes, code examples, and problem-solving exercises focused on Java programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

It covers core Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming (OOP), and essential DSA topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, recursion, searching, and sorting. The content combines theoretical explanations with practical coding examples, organized by topic for easy navigation.

This is not a full course or tutorial series, but a comprehensive reference resource for learning Java and DSA.
